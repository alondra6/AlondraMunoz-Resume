        <div class="subheading mb-5">Therapist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> As a therapist, my mission with my clients is to never judge them for their background or their experiences. Instead, I intend to provide my clients with a safe space that they can release all their emotions in. Since, most people have trouble with opening up with others, I always want to ensure my clients that they are in a judgement-free zone. Evidently, it is not easy to instantly gain the trust of my client, therefore I must prove to them that I am the last person that is going to judge or critic them. My job as their therapist is not to judge them for their hardships in their life, but I am there to help them move past those hardships.I tend to work with a handful of clients that had the courage to share their stories with others before coming to me, however, those people were not professionally capable of providing with the advice and comfort that they needed. Because I have clients that come to me with these circumstances, it makes it harder for them to open up to me. They are under the impression that they are going to share their story again and not receive any help return.   <br><br>

        Before becoming a professional therapist, my volunteer work began with working with kids that came from unstable homes. I was not neccesarily there to substitute for an actual therapist, but I was just there to provide them with company. At the beginning, the kids were only comfortable enough to talk amongst each other or with any staff that had been there for a while. It was not an easy process for the kids to open up me with, considering that I was an absolute stranger. However, compared to kids that do come from a stable household, they are more likely to engage with strangers at a faster rate. The kids that came from a unstable household were fearful of having to engage with strangers because of the possibility of being abandoned once again. It was a day by day process in order for the kids to show some engagement with the new volunteer workers. Slowly but surely, the kids became use to my daily presence and they began to engage with me.Obviously, I did not earn their trust as soon as they became welcoming of my presence. It first consisted of just being able to bond with them and let the time pass by. You could easily tell that they were beyond grateful for the company that we provided them. It was not until weeks later that the children would find themselves talking about their experiences at home. We were not allowed to ask them questions about their hardships, but we were just their to listen to them. Even though we were not providing them with advice or couseling them, they felt relieved that they could share this information with someone.   <br><br>

        After countless hours with these children, I landed myself another opportunity, where children could share their stories and I could respond back to them. I was still not at the point where I could provide them with professional help yet, but I was able to help them in my own unique way. For example, when I found myself with children that had anger issues, I would set up activities that would help them relieve that stress elsewhere. One of the activities that most of the children liked was painting. There were some of the children that transferred their emotions onto the paper in a calm manner and then there were other children that loved to get lost in their emotions. To explain, there were children that illustrated their stories onto paper, but then there were other children that loved to explode their emotions on the paper by splashing the colors everywhere.
